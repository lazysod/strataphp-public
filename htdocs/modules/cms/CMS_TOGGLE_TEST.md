# CMS Toggle Test Instructions

## Testing CMS Enable/Disable Functionality

### Current Configuration
The CMS module is currently **ENABLED** in your config. Here's how to test the toggle:

### Test Steps:

1. **Test Current State (CMS Enabled)**
   - Visit `/` - should show CMS homepage
   - Visit `/user/login` - should show modern CMS-themed login
   - Login as admin - should redirect to `/admin/cms`

2. **Disable CMS Module**
   Edit `/htdocs/app/config.php` and change:
   ```php
   'cms' => array (
       'enabled' => false,  // Change from true to false
       'suitable_as_default' => false,
   ),
   ```

3. **Test Disabled State (CMS Disabled)**
   - Visit `/` - should show basic StrataPHP homepage (fallback)
   - Visit `/user/login` - should show basic StrataPHP themed login
   - Login as admin - should redirect to `/admin` (basic admin panel)
   - All functionality should work with default themes

4. **Re-enable CMS Module**
   Change back to:
   ```php
   'cms' => array (
       'enabled' => true,   // Change back to true
       'suitable_as_default' => false,
   ),
   ```

5. **Verify Re-enabled State**
   - All CMS functionality should return
   - Modern themes should be back
   - Admin redirects to `/admin/cms`

### Expected Results:

✅ **When CMS Enabled:**
- Modern CMS themes for user pages
- CMS admin dashboard
- Dynamic page routing
- Rich admin interface

✅ **When CMS Disabled:**  
- Basic StrataPHP themes (graceful fallback)
- Basic admin panel at `/admin`
- Standard routing
- All core functionality preserved

### Key Benefits:
- **Zero Data Loss** - CMS content preserved when disabled
- **Graceful Degradation** - Site remains fully functional
- **Easy Toggle** - Single config change
- **Developer Friendly** - Easy to test both modes
- **Framework Adoption** - Users can try CMS without commitment

This makes StrataPHP much more adoption-friendly!
